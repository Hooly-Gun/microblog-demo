## MicroBlog Demo

Prototyping a commercial, scaleable Rails application and all that entails (authentication, authorization, admin, APIs, etc.)

### What does it do?

Current features include:

* Multi-provider authentication using Devise and OmniAuth.
* Authorization using CanCan and Rolify.
* An admin interface using ActiveAdmin.
* A RESTful API.

For a complete overview of the plans and current status of the project, see the [roadmap](https://github.com/jbrunton/microblog-demo/wiki/Roadmap) on the wiki.

### Documentation

For reference, details of the implementation and a series of How Tos will be put on the [the wiki](https://github.com/jbrunton/microblog-demo/wiki), as and when I find the time.
